- 👋 Hi, I’m Tomasz Skóra. I am PhD student in Chemistry at the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Polish Academy of Sciences.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer simulations of physical phenomena in general, and Brownian dynamics simulations in particular.
- ⚛️ My primary research interest is the diffusive motion of biologically relevant macromolecules (such as proteins and ribosomes) in crowded intracellular environments.
- 💻 One of my current aims is to develop a versatile software for simulations of diffusion and reactions accounting for the hydrodynamic interactions: [``pyBrown``](https://tskora.github.io/pyBrown/).
- 📫 You can reach me *via* email: tskora93@gmail.com
